# Todo:

- allow taking a piece that is checking the opposite king or just blocking (the engine probably only allow a king move if is_checked)
- allow black to promote
- get a way to choose promotion (another window or comand line)
- code first move for king and rook and make sure the engine respect the rule V (I think)
- code an best player AI
- code a me looking AI
- code en passant


# Debbug:

- change the way the game is rendered so it don't flicker
- block castling if the intermediary square is in the opposite color vision V
